Project Description:
For this project, you will implement a core part of a calculator that for a given sequence
of computation (e.g. “5 + 3 * 12 / 25”), your program is able to analyze the expression
string by extracting out numbers or operators, and finally compute the result if the input
is a valid expression. To achieve this goal, you will use the “Stack” class to store those
data and process them properly. The detailed instructions are given as below.


MyStack and ProcessStack are in package "Calculation"
Main is in package "test"
